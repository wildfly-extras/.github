Here you can find a variety of _incubating_ projects that may (or may not) eventually be promoted to the main https://github.com/wildfly['wildfly' GitHub organization]. Here you can find new and interesting things like the https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-ai-feature-pack[WildFly AI Feature Pack].

Note that because WildFly Extras projects are incubating, they are more likely to change in incompatible ways than the main WildFly project is.

Most WildFly Extras projects track their issues using GitHub issues.

If you are looking to get started with WildFly check out our https://www.wildfly.org/guides/[guides] and https://docs.wildfly.org[main documentation].
